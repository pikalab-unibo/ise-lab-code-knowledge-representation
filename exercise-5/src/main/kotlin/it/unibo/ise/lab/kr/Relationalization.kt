 *
 * Primary key attributes are assumed to be __lacking__, hence this method shall generate primary key values.
 *
 * @param predication the predicate symbol used to denote instances in the _propositional_ theory
 * @param attributes the names of the attributes which are kept implicit in the _propositional_ representation,
